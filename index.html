              <p class="lead">We have decided to hike across the Alps. Our way: from Oberstdorf to Merano, on a variant of the E5. In this blog we tell about the tour.</p>

                    <p>After 6 wonderful and varied days we reach Merano. But we have already reached our goal before, because the way was the goal.</p>

                    <h4>Day 5: Sledding and the longest stage of the tour</h4>
                    <img src="img/mittelbergferner_braunschweiger_huette.jpg" alt="Picture of the glacier Mittelbergferner"/>
                    <p>We tread in bright sunshine a very beautiful winter landscape. Via Vent we head for the Martin Busch hut. For us the way from Vent to the Martin Busch hut is the most strenuous part of the whole tour. No one talks anymore, everyone just walks. After half an eternity we finally arrive and celebrate the last evening of our tour.</p>

                    <h4>Day 4: Up to the Brunswick Hut</h4>
                    <img src="img/gratwanderung_braunschweiger_huette.jpg" alt="Ridge walk on the way to the Braunschweiger Hut"/>
                    <p>We start with a beautiful ridge walk and enjoy the alpine nature that lies at our feet on the right and left. In the background, the Tyrolean mountains present themselves from their most beautiful side. We leave the picturesque landscape behind us and climb to the Brunswick Hut. This stretch is the most strenuous of today's stage. The path leads over gravel and scree and wants to take almost no end. The muscles are burning.</p>

                    <h4>Day 3: On the way on old stone age paths</h4>
                    <img src="img/seescharte_zams.jpg" alt="Path to the Seescharte on the way to Zams"/>
                    <p>The morning begins hectically. During the night, a rockfall has damaged the water pipe to the Memminger Hut and cut off the water supply. Washing? Not a chance. Mood and weather? Icy. We set off for Zams. The path leads us over the Seescharte, a rock gate that was already used as a pass in the Stone Age. A few hours later we stroll leisurely through Zams and treat ourselves to an ice cream before taking the cable car to the hut.</p>

                    <h4>Day 2: Across the German-Austrian border to the Memminger Hut</h4>
                    <img src="img/pferdeweide_memminger_huette.jpg" alt="Photo of a horse pasture on the way to the Memminger Hut"/>
                    <p>After a short time we cross the German-Austrian border and descend to Holzgau.
        Arriving at the Memminger Hut, we enjoy our cheese spaetzle and sit back and relax. A great day.</p>

                    <h4>Day 1: Off we go to the Kemptner hut.</h4>
                    <img src="img/landschaft_kemptner_huette.jpg" alt="Landscape shot on the way to Kemptner hut"/>
                    <p>Arriving at the train station in Oberstdorf, we are already a bit excited. Hiking we were before often, but not with fully packed backpacks over 6 days. On the bus in the direction of Spielmannsau, the starting point, all sorts of questions come up again. How far is the tour again? How many hours do we have to walk per day? Will we make it?! Also already no matter. The adventure has begun, we are determined to hike in the next 6 days across the Alps from Germany to Italy.</p>
